                    <span id="data">A carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases (including carbon dioxide and methane) that are generated by our actions.
                    <br><br>
                    The average carbon footprint for a person in the United States is 16 tons, one of the highest rates in the world. Globally, the average carbon footprint is closer to 4 tons. To have the best chance of avoiding a 2â„ƒ rise in global temperatures, the average global carbon footprint per year needs to drop to under 2 tons by 2050.</span></p>

                Carbon footprints estimate the total amount of greenhouse gases emitted during the production, processing and retailing of consumer goods. The aim is to identify major sources of emissions in supply chains to inform relevant stakeholders so that actions can be taken to reduce emissions.
               
                The carbon footprint is also an important component of the Ecological Footprint, since it is one competing demand for biologically productive space. Carbon emissions from burning fossil fuel accumulate in the atmosphere if there is not enough biocapacity dedicated to absorb these emissions.</p>

                        Consume local and seasonal products (forget strawberries in winter)
                        Limit meat consumption, especially beef.
                        Select fish from sustainable fishing.
                        Bring reusable shopping bags and avoid products with excessive plastic packaging.
                        Make sure to buy only what you need, to avoid waste</p> </div>
