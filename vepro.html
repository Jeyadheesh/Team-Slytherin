                    The chair of the UN panel on climate change (IPCC), Rajendra Pachauri, says that the best thing people can do to fight against climate change is eat less meat.

Going vegan will have the biggest effect, but even going vegetarian, or cutting out as much meat as possible can have a huge impact on the environment.

Eating less meat leads to fewer farmed animals, which consume a lot of resources to raise.

On average, a vegan diet saves:

4,200 liters of water per day.
20.4 kilograms of grains per day.
9.1 kilograms CO2 equivalent per day.
2.8 meters squared of forested land per day.
Those are significant numbers, which illustrate that one person can make a difference.

At this point, it's important to understand that animal agriculture, is just one of the ways that our food and living decisions affect the environment.

If you're interested in minimizing your environmental impact, take a close look at the resources in the following sections.
